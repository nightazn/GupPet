# GupPet
Unofficial changes to the WoW addon GupPet for DragonFlight.

Used grimmtooths modifications as the starting point for all changes
https://bitbucket.org/grimmlabs/guppet/src/master/

Known Issues:
1. Opening GupPet options will generate a 'Interface/SharedXML/SharedUIPanelTemplates.lua:503: attempt to index field 'Text' (a nil value)' error.
2. The top left button for locking the ingame buttons does not work.  All other 3 buttons do work.
